**Instructions for Cloning:

Mark this page as a "template" and you will be able to use it for all future projects when creating a new repository!

In the command line enter:

$ git clone https://github.com/nconn34/enterrepositorynamehere

** Then enter:


$ npm install


$ npm run build


$ npm install dotenv-webpack@2.0.0 --save-dev (in case you have not run this previously)

Create a .env file in your root directory and type "API_KEY="

Then, in the .env add any API keys you are trying to work with.


$ npm start will run the dev server


Then you are ready to start testing and breaking code! Have fun!
