Galactic Age Calculator

Author: Nathan Conn

This is a webpage where a user can determine which planet they want to live their remaining days on as life on Earth appears to be fading!

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery-3.6.0
* Node.js
* webpack
* Lint
* Babel

## Description

Users will be prompted by the Qwax after heeding their warning to enter their age. The program will then convert their age to the approximate age they would be in planetary years and how many years they have remaining as silly biological humans.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Any browser, with a preference for Chrome

* While filling out the form, be sure to accurately describe your age

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs, however I did not make this page as functional as I would like to. I will continue to work on this on my own time and make this page more functional, and will include a dropdown menu where humans will answer certain demographic and health information which will alter their expected outcome. I also want to include more messages from the Qwax egging on the user as they deliberate this very serious decision!
